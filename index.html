		<p> To my most lovely jajayn. Happy two years, or 24 months, of love! I'd like you to know that I'm still falling in love with you, and that you're becoming more beautiful and sexier as time passes. I'm extremely proud of you, baby, for your success in the tiniest of things, as well as your academic achievements. Babe, always know that I am here for you. Even if there is a fight or a misunderstanding, I will always be there for you. I'm just here for you to lean on and support you through all of your problems. We've come a long way and gained a lot of experience in our relationship we will soon reach our life goals, baby. I hope and pray that even if we become successful in life, we will continue to be together and you will remain in my side. Baby, I appreciate everything you've done for me, especially your tolerance with me despite my stubbornness. Thank you for your concern, and I adore you for being so clinging. Once again, happy second anniversary, my baby. I love you so much my darling, and I miss you!ðŸ˜˜
